# Preside Content Library Extension

This extension provides your Preside applications with a content library that can be used to create pieces of content that can be shared in multiple places. In addition, each content item can have a set of conditional alternatives; for example: show some alternative content when user is already booked on Event X.

## Requirements

This extension requires **Preside 10.9.0** or higher.

## Installation

Install with Commandbox:

```
box install preside-ext-content-library
```

## Usage

### Creating content

On installation, you should see a "Content library" menu item in the admin beneath the site tree menu item. From here, users can add pieces of content, including configuring conditional alternatives.

### Including content

From any richeditor with Preside widgets available, insert the "Content library" widget and choose the piece of content you wish to insert.
